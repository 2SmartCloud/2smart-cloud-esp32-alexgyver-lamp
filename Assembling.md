It is best to upload the firmware on the board before you start assembling the lamp.
Firmware uploading instructions - [Firmware-Uploading](Firmware-Uploading.md)


### Assembling
1. Prepare the touch button - unsolder the diode (if we donâ€™t want it to glow) and put a jumper on the A pad.

8. Connect **through the soldered micro-usb** power supply and check that the matrix is working.

## At this stage, you get a ready-to-use controller to which you can connect not only an LED matrix, but also use it as a device for controlling addressable LED strips.




9. Pass the wires of the touch button through the hole in the tube and solder to the board, the signal wire directly to pin ```D19```.

14. Put the lid on the inner tube without pressing tightly, if after assembly the lamp switches modes by itself, the lid should be slightly raised.
